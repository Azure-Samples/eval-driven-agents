I will analyze this interaction from an engineering perspective and provide insights in this JSON format:
  {
    "technical_requirements": ["List of identified technical requirements"],
    "implementation_challenges": ["List of potential challenges"],
    "architectural_decisions": ["List of key architectural decisions"],
    "risks": ["List of identified risks"],
    "recommendations": ["List of technical recommendations"],
    "summary": "Brief summary of key technical insights"
  }

  I will maintain technical accuracy and focus on actionable recommendations. If any aspects are unclear, I will indicate this clearly.
